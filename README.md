 Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app and wants to make some changes to the app to take it to next level. Jack wants to display the weather description, and then wants to add an input statement to filter data for ideal weather. The ideal weather data will be used to identify potential travel destinations and bearby hotels. The travel destination and near by hotel data will be used to create a vacation itinerary between cities to travel. And with gmaps direction API, will be able to create the marker layers for vacation itinerary.
